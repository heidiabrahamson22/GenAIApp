This is python code to build and deploy a chatbot that answers questions on University of Chicago's Master's of Science in Applied Data Science program. The python code scrapes UChicago's website and embeds the information into a vector store to be retrieved to aid in answering questions like a program advisor would. 

Tools used in this notebook are:
  - Beautiful Soup (Webscraping)
  - Langchain (RAG Workflow)
  - OpenAI (Embeddings + LLM)
  - FAISS (Vector Store)
  - Streamlit (Chatbot UI)

The link to the app is https://genaiapp-vyjvcvt9dd4ab5wizyfnf3.streamlit.app/. Each user will be requested to provide an OpenAI key.
